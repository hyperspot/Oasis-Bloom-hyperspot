## Project Name

Hyperspot Platform

## Overview

Hyperspot is an Ethereum-based fixed-rate lending platform. A fixed interest rate is different from a variable or stable interest rate because the interest rate does not change over the term of the loan.

## Features

It will be a challenge for users to match loans to each other under the exact conditions.Because of the large pools of liquidity, banks have traditionally acted as intermediaries - charging high fees - for borrowers and lenders to interact with them.Hyperspot eliminates intermediaries and maintains on-chain pools of liquidity that are readily available as off-the-shelf counterparties for individual users.
